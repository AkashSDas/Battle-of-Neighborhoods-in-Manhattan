### About Manhattan

`Manhattan` is a major central city for diversity since many people from different cultural atmospheres have brought their families and dreams to Manhattan. The city has consistently seen people from around the world move to the city and call it home. It has been a center for trade and economic growth. Manhattan is known world wide as a cultural melting pot. While other states have had immigration surges, none have compared to the diversity and sheer number of immigrants that have made their way to the City. So these number of varies cultures combined to create a great diversity for itself. Since People from all over the world tend to come up here, we can see some many of their cultural aspects Transport, Food, Clothing, and so onâ€¦

### Problem Description

`Restaurant` is a place where people come to have food and drinks for a cost, People love to do many things and try something new or stick with their own routines, it depends on the individual and there are so many of them with different cultural and various aspects in Manhattan. There are so many cuisines, which is based on the style of cooking, the ingredients, dishes and techniques. For our problem lets stick with Indian cuisine.

> Letâ€™s assume in this one of the worldâ€™s most diverse region we want to open an Indian restaurant, so what are all the factors we have to take into account such as follows,

- Market Places
- Competition in particular location
- Aiding places that make people come to restaurants like Gym, \* Entertaining Public places
- Population
- Menu from competitors
  > And so onâ€¦ So our solution needs to be data driven for avoiding or considering low risk criteria and high success rate and thus apply our overall knowledge in the techniques and the tools gained so far in this course.
